Evaluation:
1. **Task Success**  
   **Score: 80**  
   Justification: The customer's initial query about the weather was addressed correctly, and the song request was fulfilled. However, the dialogue could have included more detailed weather information, such as wind speed or a more comprehensive forecast.

2. **Helpfulness & Relevance**  
   **Score: 85**  
   Justification: The responses were generally relevant to the customer's queries. The agent provided specific answers to the weather and song requests. However, the dialogue could have included more context or additional information about the weather.

3. **Faithfulness & Accuracy**  
   **Score: 75**  
   Justification: The weather information provided (90 degrees and 7% chance of rain) may not be accurate for Mill Valley on March 4th, as it is typically cooler. The humidity response also seems low for that temperature. The song information appears correct, but the weather data raises concerns about accuracy.
