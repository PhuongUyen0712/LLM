Dramas are usually the most realistic and the most ordinary type of movies that you can go and see.

It is an epic film, and to me, it doesn't do well with its epicness. It is rather ordinary, and the two main characters, while likable, would have been better suited for something of a smaller scale, despite the overall grand nature of the story they were trying to tell in the historical aspect. And the other thing is that it just\tENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES\t3,3,3\nUSER\tIt's It's so such a over hyped movie and it's just, I don't know, ordinary. It's not something that's overly enjoyable and it's nothing that you want to keep watching over and over again.
